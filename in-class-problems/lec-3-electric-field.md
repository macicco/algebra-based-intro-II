#### in-lecture problem 3

+ New idea: A charge makes an electric field and that electric field can exert a force on other charges. The unit of electric field is N/C (Newtons per Coulomb).
+ A positive charge makes an electric field that points away form the charge. A negative charge makes an electric field that points towards the charge.
+ New equation: Electric field, $\vec{E}$ of a point charge with charge $q$ a distance $d$ from the point charge:

$$
|\vec{E}| = k\frac{|q|}{d^2}.
$$


# Problem

A charge $q_1$ equal to 0.600 $\mu C$ is at the origin, and a second charge $q_2$ equal to 0.800 $\mu C$ is on the x axis at 0.05 meters away. As usual, unless told otherwise *assume these charges do not move and are held in place by some structure not mentioned in the problem*. (a) Find the electric field at a point halfway between them. (b) What force (magnitude and direction) would a third charge, whose charge was $q_3=+0.2\mu C$?
