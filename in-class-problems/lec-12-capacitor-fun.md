#### in-lecture problem 9

+ New idea:
    + Capacitors in a circuit can be treated as equivalent to a single capacitor.
    + Placing a material other than air between the plates of a capacitor increases its capacitance.
+ New equations:
    + $C_{equiv}$ (write in details yourself...)
    + $C=\kappa C_{air}$

**There are problems on both sides.**

# Problem

1. What is the equivalent capacitance of the combination of capacitors on the screen?

2. A parallel plate capacitor has plates that are 1cm by 2cm and are separated by a distance of 1mm by a piece of paper. What is the capacitance of this capacitor? Paper has a dielectric constant of $\kappa=2.7$.
