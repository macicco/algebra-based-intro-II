#### in-lecture problem 11

+ New idea:
    + None, more practice with multiple capacitors.

**There are problems on both sides.**

# Problem

1. Consider the network of capacitors shown below. The potential difference from a to b is 75V. Find the potential difference across and charge of each capacitor when the system is in equilibrium.
