#### in-lecture problem 6

+ New idea:
    + Electrostatic potential energy can be calculated from charge and potential.
+ New equations:
    + $\Delta U= q\Delta V$

**There are problems on both sides.**

# Problem

1. A lightning bolt transfers 20 C of charge to Earth through an average potential difference of 30 MV. How much energy is dissipated in the bolt?

2. A potential difference exists between the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane of a cell. The inner sur- face is negative relative to the outer surface. If $1.5 \times 10^{-20}$ J of work is required to eject a positive sodium ion (Na$^+$) from the interior of the cell, what is the potential difference between the inner and outer surfaces of the cell?
