#### in-lecture problem 8

+ New idea:
    + A capacitor stores energy by holding charge.
+ New equations:
    + $Q=CV$
    + $U = QV/2$

**There are problems on both sides.**

# Problem

1. There are two other ways the energy stored by a capacitor is commonly written. One is $U=Q^2/(2C)$. Find the other way; in that one only $C$ and $V$ are in the formula for $U$.

2. A defibrillator containing a 20.0 $\mu$F capacitor is used to shock the heart of a patient by holding it to the patientâ€™s chest. Just prior to discharging, the capacitor has a voltage of 10.0 kV across its plates.
    3. How much energy is released into the patient, assuming no energy losses?
    4. What is the charge on the capacitor just before it discharges?
