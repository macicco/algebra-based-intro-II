#### in-lecture problem 12

+ New idea:
    + Resistors can be in series or parallel like capacitors.
    + The formulae for combining resistors are different than the formulae for combining capacitors.
+ New equations:
    * Resistors **IN SERIES:** $R_{eq}=R_1 + R_2$.
    * Resistors **IN PARALLEL:** $1/R_{eq} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2$.

**There are not problems on both sides. Only this side. The other side should be blank (unless you wrote on it).**

# Problem

1. You have a 18$\Omega$ and a 6$\Omega$ resistor.
    a. If you connect the two resistors **in series**, what is the equivalent resistance?
    b. If you connect the two resistors **in parallel**, what is the equivalent resistance?
