# Lab 1: CONDUCTORS & INSULATORS

### Equipment

- Tape
-   Various rods and scraps of fur and assorted fabrics
-   Coffee can “ice pail”
-   Glass beaker or jar
-   Vernier charge sensor (four set up per room)
-   Electrophorus supplies (tape, Styrofoam/plastic plate and cup, Al
    foil and Al pie plate)


## Conceptual (C-Level) -- do before lab in Sapling (link in D2L).

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

In this lab your writeup will be primarily writing. You should address the items below, supporting those answers with the observations you make during the lab. If you want to include a drawing to illustrate your reasoning you can, but you do not need to.

- Construct a few pairs of B/T tape pieces (instructions in the pre-lab on sapling), then describe the interactions between
    - A pair of T pieces
    - A pair of B pieces
    - A B piece and a T piece
- Based on your observations, how many kinds of charge are there? How do you know?
- Hold a B piece near an *uncharged* object, describe what happens and why. Be sure to verify using one of the charge sensors set up in the room that the uncharged object really is uncharged.
- Measure the charge of a B tape and a T tape with charge sensor and compare them.

There is no A-level for this lab  (but you will get 10 points for it anyway).
