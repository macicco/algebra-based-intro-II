# Lab 8: Induction

### Additional Equipment

-   DMM, oscilloscope, function generator and step-down transformers.
-   Solenoid, magnets, battery eliminator and connectors (BNC, banana
    and alligator)
-   Inductive brake, inductive wand with gap magnet. St. Louis motors.
-   Demo apparatus: jumping ring and conductive pipe with rare-earth
    magnet

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Students will be asked questions about:

+ How to move a magnet to induce a current (using PhET simulation).
+ How to set up the function generator for part 2 of the B-level.

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

You will be measuring time-varying voltage signals.

- Your goal in this part is to explain, in terms of Farady's Law, the voltage probe reading you observe when moving a cow magnet into or out of a small solenoid, like you used in the magnetic field lab.  You should take data on at least four cases, ideally all in the same collection run (you can extend the amount of time LoggerPro collects data if you need to): insert the magnet quickly; remove the magnet quickly; insert the magnet slowly; remove the magnet slowly. Your write-up should focus on explaining, using Faraday's Law, how the amplitude and sign of the voltage pulse is related to the way you were using the magnet.
- *Work with another group on this part.* Get one of the very large 4,000 turn solenoids and place your small solenoid inside it. Connect the voltage probe to the *large* solenoid and connect the *small* solenoid to a function generator. In a single data collection run on LoggerPro, measure the potential difference in the large solenoid at three different frequencies on the function generator: 1Hz, 2Hz, 5Hz. *Note: You will not be able to get these frequencies exactly, but should, with some practice, be able to get within 0.01Hz of these frequencies.* **Your write-up should:**
    - explain, using Faraday's Law, why the observed signal changes the way it does as you change the frequency;
    - compare, including uncertainty, the observed increase in voltage when you change from 1Hz to 5Hz with the increase expected from Faraday's


## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose **ONE** of the topics below to *carry out*, investigate and explain. Your write-up should include a very detailed explanation the effect you observe.

-   There are two different aluminum wands that may be mounted on a
    rotary motion sensor. Mount each one and let it swing between the
    poles of the mounted magnet pair. Explain why the solid plate slows down, then explain why the slitted plate doesn't.
-   Drop a strong magnet down a conductive pipe, then drop the same magnet down a non-conducting pipe **(make sure you have something soft under the pipe for the magnet to land on).** Explain why the magnet moves slowly through the conducting pipe.
-   Propose your own idea *(get instructor approval before you begin)*.
