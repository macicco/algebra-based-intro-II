## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB


Describe what Faraday’s Law is using your own words.

Run the simulation “Faraday’s Electromagnetic Lab” , and examine the
following parts: (<http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/faraday>)

-   Under the “Pickup Coil” tab, move the magnet into and out of the
    coil. Start with the magnet on the left, with the N pole closest to
    the coil. Explain the direction of the current as the magnet moves
    towards the loop, and away from the coil.
-   Repeat for the S pole being closest to the coil.
-   Use the voltmeter instead of the light bulb, and describe what
    happens to the voltage driving the current when the magnet is moved
    faster.

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

You will be measuring time-varying voltage signals.

- Your goal in this part is to explain, in terms of Farady's Law, the voltage probe reading you observe when moving a cow magnet into or out of a small solenoid, like you used in the magnetic field lab.  You should take data on at least four cases, ideally all in the same collection run (you can extend the amount of time LoggerPro collects data if you need to): insert the magnet quickly; remove the magnet quickly; insert the magnet slowly; remove the magnet slowly. Your write-up should focus on explaining, using Faraday's Law, how the amplitude and sign of the voltage pulse is related to the way you were using the magnet.
- *Work with another group on this part.* Get one of the very large 4,000 turn solenoids and place your small solenoid inside it. Connect the voltage probe to the *large* solenoid and connect the *small* solenoid to a function generator. In a single data collection run on LoggerPro, measure the potential difference in the large solenoid at three different frequencies on the function generator: 1Hz, 2Hz, 5Hz. *Note: You will not be able to get these frequencies exactly, but should, with some practice, be able to get within 0.01Hz of these frequencies.* **Your write-up should:**
    - explain, using Faraday's Law, why the observed signal changes the way it does as you change the frequency;
    - compare, including uncertainty, the observed increase in voltage when you change from 1Hz to 5Hz with the increase expected from Faraday's


## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose **ONE** of the topics below to investigate.

-   There are three different aluminum wands that may be mounted on a
    rotary motion sensor. Mount each one and let it swing between the
    poles of the mounted magnet pair. Measure the time it takes for each
    of the wands to come to a stand still. Hypothesize why the wands
    slow down differently, based on your understanding of Faraday’s Law
    of Induction.
-   Determine the terminal velocity of magnet in free-fall through
    conductive pipe. Compare theory to experiment.
-   Use an oscilloscope to determine the amplitude and frequency for the
    output from the step-down transformer. Compare with DMM voltage
    reading.
-   Connect one of the small hand-cranked “genencon” generators to the
    input of an oscilloscope. Map out the DC level of the output versus
    frequency of cranking, and relate to Faraday’s Law of Induction.
    Although the generator is a DC generator, notice there is a small AC
    component that may be investigated as well.
-   Determine the voltage signal from a Hall Effect probe positioned
    near a working St Louis motor. Make sure to include a diagram of
    your setup and expected DC and AC signals. Note: Use the Faraday’s
    Law simulation to determine what to expect when you create a
    generator.
-   Can you measure a signal in a solenoid surrounding a conductive pipe
    when a magnet is dropped through the pipe?
-   Determine the motor frequency as a function of current through the
    electromagnet in a St Louis motor.
-   Examine the signal produced when one of the coil wands swings
    between the poles of the mounted magnet pair. The coil wands may be
    mounted on a rotary motion sensor.
