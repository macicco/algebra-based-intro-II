# Lab 4: Defibrillator I: Electrical Energy and Capacitors

### Equipment

-   Digital multimeter
-   voltage probe
-   1 Farad capacitor, battery eliminator, light bulb and holder,
    Christmas lights, hand generator, alligator clips, knife switch

### Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

### Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Connect the 1-Farad capacitor to the hand generator. Crank a bit,
  stop (remove your hand from the handle) and explain what you
  observe.
- Connect the hand generator to a battery eliminator **set at 3V**. Describe the behavior of the generator.
- How is a capacitor different from a battery (or battery eliminator)?
- Add a light bulb in series with the capacitor and battery eliminator **set at 5V** and
  describe how the brightness of the bulb changes with time. Explain why the brightness changes the way it does.
- After the bulb's brightness stops changing, disconnect the battery eliminator from the circuit and make a circuit with just the capacitor and the bulb, observe what happens and describe it. Explain why the bulb doesn't stay brightly lit.
- Try connecting the bulb to the battery eliminator **set at 5V**. Why does the bulb behave differently when connected to the capacitor than when it is connected to the battery eliminator?
- Repeat for the light bulb and capacitor in parallel. Describe what you observe and explain why it happens.
- Does the order of the light bulb and capacitor matter? Does the
arrangement (parallel vs series) matter?

### Advanced Lab Ideas (A-level) Choose ONE

+ Repeat the parts of the B-level with the light bulb, but with two capacitors:
    * In series
    * In parallel
  and explain the differences you see.
+ Measure the capacitance by using a voltage meter to measure the voltage as a function of time, fitting the appropriate curve, and calculating the capacitance from it. Your LA will help you measure the resistance of your light bulb.
+ Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
  about (get your lab instructorâ€™s approval first)
