# Snell’s Law (refraction)

### Additional Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Light travels in a straight line except when it encounters an interface
(don’t worry about curved space right now). View the following demos:

Draw a picture showing the refraction of light for the following
situations. Clearly indicate where the actual object is located and
where the image is located. Indicate apparent depth and actual depth as
well as what assumptions you make.

-   You are looking at a fish under water (n~water~ \> n~air~).

-   You are looking up at a bird while swimming under water.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations (IN LAB)*</span>:

-   Using a rectangular object examine a single ray of light as it
    enters and leaves the object. When is the offset greatest?

-   Try other objects (an equilateral triangle is interesting). What do
    you notice?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Using Snell’s Law, determine the index of refraction for one of the
plastic objects.

-   Any object is fine to use. You just need to find a procedure to
    > measure the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.

-   Make an appropriate plot of your angular data and use a linear fit
    > to find the index of refraction.

> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: The half-moon
> object simplifies the procedure

Beware of stray light rays! The height of the light ray from the light
box (the slit height) is greater than the height of the plastic objects.
You will always see an un-refracted ray illuminate the top of these
objects. If it bothers you use tape to reduce the slit height.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Determine and demonstrate the critical angle for a plastic object.

-   Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
    about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )
