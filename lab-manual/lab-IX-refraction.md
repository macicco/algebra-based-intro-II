# Snell’s Law (refraction)

### Additional Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB IN SAPLING

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Using Snell’s Law, determine the index of refraction for one of the
plastic objects.

- Any object is fine to use. You just need to find a procedure to
  measure the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.
- Make an appropriate plot of your angular data and use a linear fit
  to find the index of refraction.

*Note: The half-moon object simplifies the procedure.*

Beware of stray light rays! The height of the light ray from the light
box (the slit height) is greater than the height of the plastic objects.
You will always see an un-refracted ray illuminate the top of these
objects. If it bothers you use tape to reduce the slit height.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

- Determine and demonstrate the critical angle for a plastic object.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
  about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )
