# Lab 7: Magnetic fields

### Additional Equipment

- DMM and battery eliminator
- Solenoid
- Cow magnet

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

In this lab you will measure the relationship between the current in a solenoid and the magnetic field produced inside the solenoid, and map out the shape of the magnetic field outside the solenoid.

### Field inside solenoid

+ Use the battery eliminator to provide potential/current. Start on the lowest voltage setting.
+ Use a DMM to measure the current; be sure to set up the DMM correctly and add it to the circuit correctly to measure current.
+ Use the magnetic field sensor, set to the 6mT range, to measure the magnetic field.
+ Record current and field readings for several battery eliminator voltages; include an estimated uncertainty in the magnetic field reading.
+ In a new LoggerPro file, plot magnetic field vs current and comment on whether it is consistent with the expected relationship , $B=\mu_0 n I$.

### Field outside solenoid

+ Use a compass to measure the direction of the magnetic field of the solenoid outside the solution (note: be careful that you are simply measuring the Earth's magnetic field).
+ Measure the strength of the field at a few points outside the solenoid and comment its size compared to the size of the field inside the solenoid.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose **ONE** of the topics below to investigate.

+ Measure $n$ for your solenoid (calipers/rulers are available to help with that) and compare to the value you get from fitting your data from the B-level.
+ Measure how the magnetic field of the solenoid outside the solenoid depends on distance if you move along the axis of the solenoid. Measure your distance from the **center** of the solenoid to measuring tip of the magnetic field sensor. Fit a power law to your data and compare the power you get to the expected value (3).
+ Measure the magnetic field of a cow magnet outside  the magnet depends on distance if you move along the axis of the solenoid. Measure your distance from the **center** of the solenoid to measuring tip of the magnetic field sensor. Fit a power law to your data and compare the power you get to the expected value (3).
+ Measure the magnetic field of the Earth using either a solenoid and compass or the magnetic field sensor. NOTE: you need to be sure you are orienting the compass or sensor correctly to measure the full magnetic field of the Earth!
+ Build a simple speaker.
+ Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something related to current and magnetic field that you are curious about. *Get your lab instructor's approval before beginning.*
