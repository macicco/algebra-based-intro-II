# Lenses

### Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics
-   Optical bench, with assorted mounts and optics (pinhole and lenses)

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Explore image formation and refractive lenses.

SEE DELETED RAY TRACING WORKSHEET

Complete the ray tracing worksheet. Trace the rays to determine the
image location for an object in the following situations:

-   Converging lens (inside and outside the focal point)

-   Diverging lens (inside and outside the focal point)

How would your ray tracing change if the lens material had a smaller
index of refraction than the medium in which it was placed? (for
instance, an air lens placed in water)

-   Form an image of an object on a screen with a lens. What happens to
    the image when you cover the top half of the lens?

# Lab 12: LIGHT SPECTRA

### Additional Equipment

-   Photometers, spectrometers, gratings

-   Various light sources

-   Light boxes and color filters

## Conceptual (C-Level)

Given an ideal point source of light that radiates in all directions
determine what shape you expect the irradiance as a function of radial
distance to look like. As a reminder, take a look at the simulation:
http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/InverseSquareLaws/

Graph the “ideal” spectrum (intensity as a function of λ and *f* ) for
the following:

-   A blue object

<!-- -->

-   A red object

-   A yellow object

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations*</span>: Put on the
diffraction glasses (also called “fireworks glasses”) and observe
different light sources. What do you notice?
