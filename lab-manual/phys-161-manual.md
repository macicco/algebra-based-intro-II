# Lab 9: SNELL’S LAW (REFRACTION)

### Additional Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Light travels in a straight line except when it encounters an interface
(don’t worry about curved space right now). View the following demos:

Draw a picture showing the refraction of light for the following
situations. Clearly indicate where the actual object is located and
where the image is located. Indicate apparent depth and actual depth as
well as what assumptions you make.

-   You are looking at a fish under water (n~water~ \> n~air~).

<!-- -->

-   You are looking up at a bird while swimming under water.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations (IN LAB)*</span>:

-   Using a rectangular object examine a single ray of light as it
    enters and leaves the object. When is the offset greatest?

-   Try other objects (an equilateral triangle is interesting). What do
    you notice?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Using Snell’s Law, determine the index of refraction for one of the
plastic objects.

-   Any object is fine to use. You just need to find a procedure to
    > measure the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.

-   Make an appropriate plot of your angular data and use a linear fit
    > to find the index of refraction.

> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: The half-moon
> object simplifies the procedure

Beware of stray light rays! The height of the light ray from the light
box (the slit height) is greater than the height of the plastic objects.
You will always see an un-refracted ray illuminate the top of these
objects. If it bothers you use tape to reduce the slit height.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Determine and demonstrate the critical angle for a plastic object.

-   Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
    about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )

Lab 10: LENSES

### Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics

-   Optical bench, with assorted mounts and optics (pinhole and lenses)

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Explore image formation and refractive lenses.

<http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/RayTracingWithLenses/>

<http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/RayDiagramsForLenses/>

Complete the ray tracing worksheet. Trace the rays to determine the
image location for an object in the following situations:

-   Converging lens (inside and outside the focal point)

-   Diverging lens (inside and outside the focal point)

How would your ray tracing change if the lens material had a smaller
index of refraction than the medium in which it was placed? (for
instance, an air lens placed in water)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations (in lab)*</span>:

-   Form an image of an object on a screen with a lens. What happens to
    the image when you cover the top half of the lens?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

-   Determine the focal length of two different converging lens (and
    compare with stated value)

    -   Set up an object, and determine the position of the image as the
        object distance from the lens is varied.

    -   Graph the image location versus the object location, and compare
        the resulting function to what is expected.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

-   Use two lenses to construct a telescope. Compare the performance of
    your telescope to what you expect.

-   Explore the physics of the eye, and find a way to test your
    eyesight.

-   Investigate optical illusions and construct one

-   Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
    about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )

# Lab 12: LIGHT SPECTRA

### Additional Equipment

-   Photometers, spectrometers, gratings

-   Various light sources

-   Light boxes and color filters

## Conceptual (C-Level)

Given an ideal point source of light that radiates in all directions
determine what shape you expect the irradiance as a function of radial
distance to look like. As a reminder, take a look at the simulation:
http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/InverseSquareLaws/

Graph the “ideal” spectrum (intensity as a function of λ and *f* ) for
the following:

-   A blue object

<!-- -->

-   A red object

-   A yellow object

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations*</span>: Put on the
diffraction glasses (also called “fireworks glasses”) and observe
different light sources. What do you notice?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

-   Measure intensity/irradiance as a function of distance for a light
    source.

    -   Comment on the shape of your graph. What did you expect to see?

-   Using the spectrometer, graph the spectra from three different
    spectral tubes [H, He, Ne, Hg].

    -   Determine the expected spectra and compare with your results.
        Use the diffraction glasses to help you. <span
        style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: Consider
        referencing other sources for information on spectral lines.

***Danger High Voltage!*** The spectra tubes are powered by a high
voltage source. Make sure the source is unplugged before changing tubes.

***Caution Fragile!*** The spectra tubes are fragile. Please handle the
tubes by their ends. Please avoid getting oil (from your hands) on the
tubes – especially the center thin region.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Graph the spectra from other light sources.

    -   Incandescent light bulb (try dimming it), candle, fluorescent
        light bulb…

-   Graph absorption and/or transmission spectra for different
    solutions.

    -   Chloroplasts or a concentration of creamer in water.
