### Additional Equipment

-   Extra DC voltage source (battery eliminator)

-   Water, tray and various conductors and non-conductors

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Describe how the electric field is related to voltage (electric
potential), both symbolically (mathematically) and semantically (written
description).

Draw the equipotential lines (lines of constant voltage) and electric
field lines for the

-   Parallel plates at two different voltages (top diagram to shown to
    the right)

-   Point charges at two different voltages (bottom diagram shown to the
    right).

Use different colors for the equipotentials and E-field lines.

Using the PhET simulation verify (or modify as necessary) your drawings.
<http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/charges-and-fields/charges-and-fields_en.html>

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

You will experimentally determine the E-field for the above two
configurations by mapping out the equipotential lines.

-   Secure (can you say “duct tape”) the conducting plates before
    putting water in the tray.

-   You need just enough water to cover the bottom of the tray.

-   Ground one conductor and connect the other conductor to +6 volts.

-   Compute the magnitude electric field at the points shown on the
    board.

-   Explain the direction of the electric field either in terms of
    forces or in terms of energy. (“What does a positive charge want to
    do when placed in that field, what about a negative charge?”)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations*</span>:
Experimentally determine the following:

-   How does the E-field change if you ground one conductor and
    connect +12 volts to the other conductor?

-   How does the E-field change if you use -3 volts and +3 volts?

-   How does the E-field change if you use the same voltage on each
    conductor?

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level) Choose ONE

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topic below is only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Determine the E-field inside and outside a conducting and an
    insulating cylinder placed between two parallel plates at different
    voltages. Note: use steel wool to remove rust and dirt from the
    conducting cylinder.

### Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Draw a schematic wiring diagram for a circuit containing a DC voltage
source (battery), capacitor and light bulb.

-   Connect the capacitor and light bulb in series.

-   Connect the capacitor and light bulb in parallel.

Will the light bulb light in your circuits? Explain.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Simulation*</span>:
<http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-ac>

Make sure to use the “AC/DC Circuit” simulation found at the link above.

-   Connect a light bulb to a battery.

-   Add a capacitor to your circuit. Wire the parts in series – which
    means connect them one after the other to make one big path or
    circuit.

-   Adding a “knife” switch in series is helpful to control when the
    circuit is closed. You can also then open the circuit, remove the
    battery, and see what happens when the switch is closed with the
    capacitor charged up. Note that the simulation shows the flow of
    negative charge (blue).

-   Comment on what you observe in the simulation. Is this what you
    expected?

### Basic Lab (B-Level)

-   Connect the 1-Farad capacitor to the hand generator. Crank a bit,
    stop (remove your hand from the handle) and explain what you
    observe. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: The
    capacitor is polarized. You must connect the positive terminals and
    negative terminals correctly.

-   Add a light bulb in series with the capacitor and generator and
    observe the circuit behavior.

-   After cranking for a bit, disconnect the generator from the circuit
    and observe.

-   Repeat for the light bulb and capacitor in parallel.

-   Does the order of the light bulb and capacitor matter? Does the
    arrangement matter?

Draw a schematic wiring diagram for a circuit containing a DC voltage
source (battery) and a resistive load (either a light bulb or resistor).

-   Show how to connect an ammeter to this circuit.

-   Show how to connect a voltmeter to this circuit.

Note: A voltmeter is connected in parallel across the object you wish to
measure the voltage drop. An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance. An
ammeter is connected in series to measure the current through an object.
An ideal ammeter has zero resistance. A fuse protects an ammeter from
too much current. Your DMM can easily be reconfigured to act as an
ammeter and measure current.

-   What happens if you connect a voltmeter incorrectly in your circuit?

-   What happens if you connect an ammeter incorrectly in your circuit?

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations*</span>:

> Carry out the following explorations with the on-line circuit
> simulation and in the lab.

    “Resistance/Ohm/Ω” setting on the DMM. Calculate the theoretical
    power used by the light bulb when operated at 3V.

-   Determine the resistance of the resistor (using color code and DMM).
    Calculate the power used by the resistor when operated at 3V.

    bulb and resistor). What does your data tell you?

    -   Please try to avoid burning out the light bulb!

-   Explain any discrepancies with theory and note any observations.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topic below is only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Use a battery and measure the voltage and current as you decrease
    the resistance in a circuit. (You may also be able to do this for
    the battery eliminator)

-   Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
    about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )

Lab 6: SERIES & PARALLEL (COMPLEX CIRCUITS)

### Equipment

-   Optional: Computer with voltage (and current) probes

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Suppose you have four resistors connected in the form of a square, as
shown below. Are these resistors in series? In parallel? Does it matter
which of the two tabs 1-4 you connect to the DMM for measuring
resistance?

Suppose you connect a battery source of voltage V~s~ between the two
tabs in the diagram labeled B and D. Predict the power that would be
drawn from the battery by the circuit, in terms of the circuit
parameters given. HINT: Find the resistance between B and D first!

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

-   Choose 4 different resistor values, and connect in the square
    arrangement shown above. Measure the resistance between all possible
    pairs of tabs A, B, C, D; compare to expected resistance. (Create a
    table with measured and expected values for each)

-   Connect a battery eliminator between tabs B and D (or any pair) in
    the arrangement shown above. Measure the power the circuit draws
    from the battery source, and compare to expected.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level) Choose ONE

-   Determine the internal resistance for a battery (note—you can’t just
    use a DMM as a resistance meter for this one).

-   Use a Wheatstone bridge to determine an unknown resistance. (We have
    setups if you want to use one)

-   Explore various arrangements of capacitors and resistors in a
    circuit.

    and alligator)

-   Inductive brake, inductive wand with gap magnet. St. Louis motors.

-   Demo apparatus: jumping ring and conductive pipe with rare-earth
    magnet

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Describe what Faraday’s Law is using your own words.

Run the simulation “Faraday’s Electromagnetic Lab” , and examine the
following parts: (<http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/faraday>)

-   Under the “Pickup Coil” tab, move the magnet into and out of the
    coil. Start with the magnet on the left, with the N pole closest to
    the coil. Explain the direction of the current as the magnet moves
    towards the loop, and away from the coil.

-   Repeat for the S pole being closest to the coil.

-   Use the voltmeter instead of the light bulb, and describe what
    happens to the voltage driving the current when the magnet is moved
    faster.

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

You will be measuring time-varying voltage signals.

-   Connect a solenoid to a voltage probe. Move a cow magnet into and
    out of the coils of the solenoid as smoothly as possible, while a
    group member times the period of motion (alternately, use a motion
    sensor). Determine the amplitude of the induced signal in the
    solenoid as a function of frequency of magnetic motion. Relate your
    findings to Faraday’s Law of induction.

-   There are three different aluminum wands that may be mounted on a
    rotary motion sensor. Mount each one and let it swing between the
    poles of the mounted magnet pair. Measure the time it takes for each
    of the wands to come to a stand still. Hypothesize why the wands
    slow down differently, based on your understanding of Faraday’s Law
    of Induction.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

-   Determine the terminal velocity of magnet in free-fall through
    conductive pipe. Compare theory to experiment.

-   Use an oscilloscope to determine the amplitude and frequency for the
    output from the step-down transformer. Compare with DMM voltage
    reading.

-   Connect one of the small hand-cranked “genencon” generators to the
    input of an oscilloscope. Map out the DC level of the output versus
    frequency of cranking, and relate to Faraday’s Law of Induction.
    Although the generator is a DC generator, notice there is a small AC
    component that may be investigated as well.

-   Determine the voltage signal from a Hall Effect probe positioned
    near a working St Louis motor. Make sure to include a diagram of
    your setup and expected DC and AC signals. Note: Use the Faraday’s
    Law simulation to determine what to expect when you create a
    generator.

-   Can you measure a signal in a solenoid surrounding a conductive pipe
    when a magnet is dropped through the pipe?

-   Determine the motor frequency as a function of current through the
    electromagnet in a St Louis motor.

-   Examine the signal produced when one of the coil wands swings
    between the poles of the mounted magnet pair. The coil wands may be
    mounted on a rotary motion sensor.

# Lab 9: SNELL’S LAW (REFRACTION)

### Additional Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Light travels in a straight line except when it encounters an interface
(don’t worry about curved space right now). View the following demos:

<http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/SnellsLawOfRefractionWaveFronts/>

<http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/FermatsPrincipleAndSnellsLaw/>

<http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/ReflectionAndRefractionOnAFlatSurfaceBetweenTwoDifferentMate/>

Draw a picture showing the refraction of light for the following
situations. Clearly indicate where the actual object is located and
where the image is located. Indicate apparent depth and actual depth as
well as what assumptions you make.

-   You are looking at a fish under water (n~water~ \> n~air~).

<!-- -->

-   You are looking up at a bird while swimming under water.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations (IN LAB)*</span>:

-   Using a rectangular object examine a single ray of light as it
    enters and leaves the object. When is the offset greatest?

-   Try other objects (an equilateral triangle is interesting). What do
    you notice?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Using Snell’s Law, determine the index of refraction for one of the
plastic objects.

-   Any object is fine to use. You just need to find a procedure to
    > measure the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.

-   Make an appropriate plot of your angular data and use a linear fit
    > to find the index of refraction.

> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: The half-moon
> object simplifies the procedure

Beware of stray light rays! The height of the light ray from the light
box (the slit height) is greater than the height of the plastic objects.
You will always see an un-refracted ray illuminate the top of these
objects. If it bothers you use tape to reduce the slit height.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Determine and demonstrate the critical angle for a plastic object.

How would your ray tracing change if the lens material had a smaller
index of refraction than the medium in which it was placed? (for
instance, an air lens placed in water)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations (in lab)*</span>:

-   Form an image of an object on a screen with a lens. What happens to
    the image when you cover the top half of the lens?

# Lab 12: LIGHT SPECTRA

### Additional Equipment

-   Photometers, spectrometers, gratings

-   Various light sources

-   Light boxes and color filters

## Conceptual (C-Level)

Given an ideal point source of light that radiates in all directions
determine what shape you expect the irradiance as a function of radial
distance to look like. As a reminder, take a look at the simulation:
http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/InverseSquareLaws/

Graph the “ideal” spectrum (intensity as a function of λ and *f* ) for
the following:

-   A blue object

<!-- -->

-   A red object

-   A yellow object

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">*Explorations*</span>: Put on the
diffraction glasses (also called “fireworks glasses”) and observe
different light sources. What do you notice?

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

-   Measure intensity/irradiance as a function of distance for a light
    source.

    -   Comment on the shape of your graph. What did you expect to see?

-   Using the spectrometer, graph the spectra from three different
    spectral tubes [H, He, Ne, Hg].

    -   Determine the expected spectra and compare with your results.
        Use the diffraction glasses to help you. <span
        style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span>: Consider
        referencing other sources for information on spectral lines.

***Danger High Voltage!*** The spectra tubes are powered by a high
voltage source. Make sure the source is unplugged before changing tubes.

***Caution Fragile!*** The spectra tubes are fragile. Please handle the
tubes by their ends. Please avoid getting oil (from your hands) on the
tubes – especially the center thin region.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

-   Graph the spectra from other light sources.

    -   Incandescent light bulb (try dimming it), candle, fluorescent
        light bulb…

-   Graph absorption and/or transmission spectra for different
    solutions.

    -   Chloroplasts or a concentration of creamer in water.
