# Lenses

### Equipment

-   Light boxes with power supply and various optics
-   Optical bench, with assorted mounts and optics (pinhole and lenses)

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Determine the focal length of two different converging lens, and
  compare with stated value.
    - Set up an object, and determine the position of the image as the
      object distance from the lens is varied.
    - Graph the image location versus the object location, and compare
      the resulting function to what is expected.
- Determine the focal length of a diverging lens and compare to the stated
  value. *Hint:* you will need to use a converging lens along with it.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

- Use two lenses to construct a telescope. Compare the performance of
  your telescope to what you expect.
- Explore the physics of the eye, and find a way to test your
  eyesight.
- Investigate optical illusions and construct one
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
  about (get your lab instructorâ€™s approval first )
