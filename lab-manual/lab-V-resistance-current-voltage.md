# Lab 5: Defibrillators II: Current, voltage, resistance

### Additional Equipment

-   DMM and battery eliminator
-   Christmas bulb
-   Resistor (50-80$\Omega$)
-   56$\Omega$ resistor, light bulb and holder, appropriate cables
-   Computer with voltage probes

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB


## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Your goal in the B-level is to measure how the current through a circuit element changes as you change the voltage applied to the element, and from that learn how the element's resistance changes with voltage (if it does change at all).

The two "elements" you will look at are a Christmas light and a resistor.

+ Use the DMM as an ammeter to measure the current flowing through the circuit, and the voltage probe to measure the actual voltage output of the battery eliminator.
    * The labeled voltage on the battery eliminator will be inaccurate when you connect the bulb, and may be inaccurate for the resistor, so it is important to actually measure the voltage it produces.
+ For the Christmas light, measure $I$ and $V$ for all potential settings on the battery eliminator, *starting at the lowest setting.* The bulb may burn out when you reach the highest setting, so make sure you start at the lowest setting and record both current and voltage.
+ Add manual columns for the voltages and currents you measured, and create a calculated column for resistance.
+ For the Christmas light, does resistance change significantly with voltage? Your answer should include a graph of resistance vs voltage.
+ Also graph voltage versus current. Is a *proportional* (not linear) fit a good fit? What about a curved line (either parabolic or exponential)?
+ Repeat your measurements for a resistor and answer the same question: does the resistance change significantly with voltage?
+ Finally, look at the web page below, which includes a graph showing how the resistance of a human changes with applied voltage. Which of the two elements you looked at in lab, the light or the resistor, is a more accurate model of the human body? [Note: *neither* is a great model, but one is better than the other.]

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose **ONE** of the topics below to investigate. The list below is only meant as
possible suggestions.

- Connect two resistors to a battery eliminator in series, and measure:
    + The potential difference across the pair of resistors.
    + The potential difference across each individual resistor.
    + The current through each resistor.
    + The current coming from the battery eliminator.
    + Summarize the relationship  between the potential difference across the battery eliminator and the difference across the resistors, and the relationship  for current.
- Connect two resistors to a battery eliminator in parallel, and measure:
    + The potential difference across the pair of resistors.
    + The potential difference across each individual resistor.
    + The current through each resistor.
    + The current coming from the battery eliminator.
    + Summarize the relationship  between the potential difference across the battery eliminator and the difference across the resistors, and the relationship  for current.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something related to voltage, current, and resistance that you are curious about. *Get your lab instructor's approval before beginning.*
