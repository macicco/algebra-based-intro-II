# Light Spectra

### Additional Equipment

- Photometers, spectrometers, gratings
- Various light sources

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Measure intensity/irradiance as a function of distance for a light
  source.
    - Comment on the shape of your graph. What did you expect to see?

- Using the spectrometer, graph the spectra from three different
  spectral tubes [H, He, Ne, Hg].

    - Determine the expected spectra and compare with your results.
      Use the diffraction glasses to help you. <span

      referencing other sources for information on spectral lines.

***Danger High Voltage!*** The spectra tubes are powered by a high
voltage source. Make sure the source is unplugged before changing tubes.

***Caution Fragile!*** The spectra tubes are fragile. Please handle the
tubes by their ends. Please avoid getting oil (from your hands) on the
tubes – especially the center thin region.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topics below are only meant as
possible suggestions.

- Graph the spectra from other light sources.
    - Incandescent light bulb (try dimming it), candle, fluorescent
      light bulb…
- Graph absorption and/or transmission spectra for different
  solutions.
    - Chloroplasts or a concentration of creamer in water.
