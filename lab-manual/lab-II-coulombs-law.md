### Equipment

- Pith balls
- rods and fur
- Vernier charge sensors (4 per room)
- Metal coffee can/jar combination (4 per room)
- Smartphone or tablet (for taking a picture of charged spheres hanging)
- ruler

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

Your goal in this part of the lab is to measure the force constant, $k$, in
Coulomb's law.

+ Work out a relationship between $k$ and the things can measure in this lab: $\tan\theta$, distance between the spheres, mass of one sphere, charge on one sphere.
+ Use one of the white rods rubbed with fur to charged the two pith balls.
+ Measure the distances you need from a picture you take of your spheres instead of trying to use a ruler directly. Include this picture in your lab write-up.
+ Use a charge sensor to measure the charge on both balls together. Use a logical argument (or the charge sensor) to work out how much charge is on *each* sphere. The spheres are conductors.
+ Calculate $k$; choose one of the things you measured that affects $k$ and use it to estimate an uncertainty in $k$.
+ Enter your result at the web site written on the board.


## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

Note: An advanced lab includes a quantitative component with error analysis. The exact question(s) explored is your choice but it should relate to the basic lab.

- Combine the class data at the web site on the board into a single measurement of $k$. Use the standard deviation of measured values to estimate the error.
- Measure the displacement of the small hanging sphere as a function
  of distance from the large one, and compare the resulting function
  to that expected from Coulomb’s Law.
- Explain how the electrophorous works.
- Propose **and carry out** a different electrostatic experiment.
