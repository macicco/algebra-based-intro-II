# Light Spectra

### Additional Equipment

- Spectrometers
- Various light sources

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Calculate the wavelengths of the emissions lines of hydrogen that are in the
  visible spectrum.

- Using the spectrometer, graph the hydrogen spectrum and compare the wavelengths
  of the emission lines you observe to the wavelengths you observe. Include some
  estimate of the uncertainty in your measured value.

- Using the spectrometer, graph the spectra from three different
  spectral tubes [He, Ne, Hg]. Compare the

    - Determine the expected spectra and compare with your results.
      Use the diffraction glasses to help you. *Note*: Consider
      referencing other sources for information on spectral lines.

**Please do not change which tube is in which holder.** The holders operate at
high voltage and the tubes are very fragile. Instead, rotate between the stations set up for each gas.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level)

CHoose *ONE* topic to investigate.

- Graph the spectra from other light sources.
    - Incandescent light bulb (try dimming it), candle, fluorescent
      light bulb
- Graph absorption and/or transmission spectra for different
  solutions.
    - Chloroplasts or a concentration of creamer in water.
- Propose *and carry out* an experiment of your choice.
