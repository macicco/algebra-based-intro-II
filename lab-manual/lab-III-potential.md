# Lab 3: POTENTIALS

### Additional Equipment

-   Extra DC voltage source (battery eliminator)
-   Water, tray and various conductors and non-conductors
-   Grid paper marked the same way as the sheets of paper under the trays.

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Describe how the electric field is related to voltage (electric
potential), both symbolically (mathematically) and semantically (written
description).

Draw the equipotential lines (lines of constant voltage) and electric
field lines for the

-   Parallel plates at two different voltages (top diagram to shown to
    the right)

-   Point charges at two different voltages (bottom diagram shown to the
    right).

Use different colors for the equipotentials and E-field lines.

Using the PhET simulation verify (or modify as necessary) your drawings.

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

You will experimentally determine the E-field for the two
configurations above by mapping out the equipotential lines.

- Secure the conducting plates before
  putting water in the tray.
- You need just enough water to cover the bottom of the tray.
- Ground one conductor and connect the other conductor to +6 volts.
- On one of your sheets of grid paper, map out equipotential lines.
- Compute the magnitude of the electric field at the points shown on the
  board.
- Explain the direction of the electric field either in terms of
  forces or in terms of energy. (“What does a positive charge want to
  do when placed in that field, what about a negative charge?”)
- How does the E-field change if you ground one conductor and
  connect +12 volts to the other conductor? Explain why it changes that way.
- How does the E-field change if you use the same voltage on each
  conductor? Explain why it changes that way.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level) Choose ONE

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topic below is only meant as
possible suggestions.

- Determine the E-field inside and outside a conducting cylinder placed
  between two parallel plates at different
  voltages. Note: use steel wool to remove rust and dirt from the
  conducting cylinder.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
  about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )
