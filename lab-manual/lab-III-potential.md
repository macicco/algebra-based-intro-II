# Lab 3: POTENTIALS

### Additional Equipment

-   Extra DC voltage source (battery eliminator)
-   Water, tray and various conductors and non-conductors
-   Grid paper marked the same way as the sheets of paper under the trays.

## Basic Lab (B-Level)
*This simulation will be helpful in understanding what the equipotential lines and field should look like:*

### Part 1

You will experimentally determine the E-field for the
parallel plate configuration above by mapping out the equipotential lines.

- Secure the conducting plates *before* putting water in the tray.
- You need just enough water to cover the bottom of the tray.
- Ground one conductor (black) and connect the other conductor to +6 volts (red).
- On one of your sheets of grid paper, map out equipotential lines. Make
  equipotential lines for at least 5 different voltages.
- Compute the magnitude of the electric field at the points shown on the
  board.
- Explain the direction of the electric field either in terms of
  forces or in terms of energy. (“What does a positive charge want to
  do when placed in that field, what about a negative charge?”)
- How does the E-field change if you ground one conductor and
  connect +12 volts to the other conductor? Explain why it changes that way.
- How does the E-field change if you use the same voltage on each
  conductor? Explain why it changes that way.

### Part 2

Go to one of the electric dipole setups. An electric dipole (a positive and an
equal but opposite negative charge) is a crude model of your heart. A simple
heart monitor measures the electric potential of your heart with a voltmeter
similar to the multimeter you are using in lab today.

In your heart the positive and negative direction changes as your heart beats,
so a heart monitor is really measuring the *change* in potential polarity
(sign of the charges) changes.

Your goal in this part is to pick two points, one for the black lead from the
multimeter and one for the red lead, that will give the biggest *change* in
voltage when you switch which point is positive and which is negative. There
is more than one correct answer here. To keep this a little realistic, you
cannot place the leads between the charge -- that would be like putting your
heart monitor *inside* your heart!

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-Level) Choose ONE

Choose your own topic to investigate. The topic below is only meant as
possible suggestions.

- Choose one of the other conductor arrangements on the course web site,
  map the equipotentials, and draw the electric field.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious
  about (get your lab instructor’s approval first )
