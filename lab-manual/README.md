# Labs

+ [lab-I-charge.md](lab-I-charge.md)

# To make PDF copies of the labs

1. Download/clone this repository to your computer.
2. Change to the directory `lab-manual`.
3. In a terminal, do one or more of these depending on what you want:
    + `make all` to generate PDF of each individual lab and the manual of all labs (including a table of contents).
    + `make manual` to generate PDF of just the manual.
    + `make lab-I-charge.pdf` to generate PDF of individual labs.
4. All generated PDFs will be put in a directory called `generated`. That directory is ignored by the git repository.
